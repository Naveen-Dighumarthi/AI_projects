I recently developed a multi-language translator that goes beyond simple text translation. This project includes:

Speech-to-Text Generation: Converts spoken words into text.
Text Translation: Translates the generated text from English to various other languages.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts the translated text back into speech, making it accessible in multiple languages.
This project demonstrates the seamless integration of speech recognition and translation technologies, making communication across languages easier and more efficient.
